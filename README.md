## Memory Game Project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree Program

### Dependencies
 - FontAwesome


### How To Install
Download a zip or clone the repo to the location of your choice. This game is purely JS and CSS so no servers or compiling are needed. Simply open the index.html file and start playing!


### How Does The Game Work?
This is a simple memory/match game. The user clicks on two cards to show their icons, if the icons match they will turn green and stay open. If the two cards do not match, they will briefly turn red before turning back over to hide the icons. Once all 8 matches are made, the game is over.

A 3 star rating is rewarded if the user completes the game in 30 moves or less. A 2 star rating is given for between 31 and 45 moves. A 1 star rating is given for a move count of 46 and higher.




Icons are from FontAwesome https://fontawesome.com/icons
